# Belly_Button
Welcome to the Belly Button Bacteria Challenge! 

#Background
In this assignment, I have built an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity datasetLinks to an external site., which catalogues the microbes that colonise human navels.

The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

Within this submission:
1. Created a horizontal bar chart with a dropdown menu to display the top 10 OTUs found in that individual.
2. Created a bubble chart that displays each sample.
3. Displayed the sample metadata, i.e., an individual's demographic information.
4. Displayed each key-value pair from the metadata JSON object somewhere on the page.
